program hello
      implicit none !The implicit none statement though not a must is quite important in fortran programming as it is used to remove
      ! a old feature of fortran which by default treats all variabes that start with the letters i,j,k,l,m,n as "integers" and all
      ! other variables as real arguments.  
      print *, "hello world"
      end program hello
